NFL Passer Rating
===================
## Technologies used
* React
* Sass
* Jest
* Webpack

I originally came up with this idea to showcase data form submission, using data to calculate an NFL passer rating based off the formula used for this.  I also added data validation to ensure the right type of data is used.

I first built this in Java, but as I moved towards JavaScript, I converted it using the React Framework, to allow more creativity with the UI, by allowing the user to have the background scheme of their NFL team of choice.  I later upgraded the app to retrieve the data from Firebase.

I do not own copyrights to any of the logos used, this project is for personal use only.
